The script will perform PSO optimization on the specified objective function. The optimization process and results will be displayed in the console and visualized in a series of plots.


Adjustable Parameters
You can adjust the parameters of the PSO algorithm in the Main within the script. Here are the adjustable parameters:

n: Number of particles
w: Inertia weight constant
c1: Cognitive coefficient
c2: Social coefficient
it: Number of iterations
x_max, x_min, y_max, y_min: Search space bounds
v_max: Maximum velocity of particles
Feel free to modify these parameters to explore how they affect the optimization process and results.


Changing the Objective Function

To change the objective function that the PSO algorithm optimizes, simply modify the depthcalc function within the script. Replace the existing objective function with the desired one.



Note
This script is a basic implementation of PSO and is designed for educational purposes. It may not be suitable for all optimization tasks or objective functions. You can extend and customize it based on your requirements.
